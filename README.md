# IDG2001-Assignment1

## install dependencies/requirements using "pip install -r requirements.txt"

- In this assignment, we will create a simple web service where a user can upload files, the
system will process them, and return new/processed files

-right now, running file_processing.py will convert csv file -> into MD files -> then PDFs -> then .tar.gz file. 

- ### Next steps:
 -- create form with upload option
 -- continue building out API using flask..
    --> make endpoints with actions etc
 
 -- the processing layer should also accept uploaded .tar.gz file with contents (csv, markdown, imgs).

 -- testing scripts
